# Python OOP Assignment 🏗️🐍

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.  
It includes two activities:

1. **Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class**
   - A `Smartphone` class with attributes and methods
   - A `Smartwatch` subclass that inherits from `Smartphone`
   - Demonstrates constructors, method overriding, and encapsulation

2. **Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge**
   - Several vehicle/animal classes that all implement a `move()` method differently
   - Demonstrates polymorphism in action
